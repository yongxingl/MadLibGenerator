# Mad Lib Generator

•	Programmed a clean interface, including Pi, Fibonacci series and Mad Libs Generator, that ask users for a list of words and output a story as desired on visual studio using HTML. 

•	Embedded Bootstrap in project files as my template; styled the interface with attractive features such as clear buttons and rounded borders using CSS 

•	Implemented those algorithms, ensured the capabilities of handling exceptions and created different short stories using test inputs by JavaScript; re-engineered the code slightly, such as the template of the story and the input types, to create other stories

Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
